Each note lasts 0.521739
Each note is separated by 200 px

So each note has to travel 200 px in 0.521739s
So each note has to travel (200 / 0.521739) = 383.333429 px/s

So dx = 383.333429 px/s

Height calculation

Example:
max = 20
min = 5
diff = 15

vertClear + ((maxMidi - noteList[i].midi) / diff) * (myCanvas.height - (2 * vertClear))
